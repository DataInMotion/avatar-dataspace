Important: All XML data must be encoded using UTF-8.

Version 500 is the first XML version of this standard.   This standard can be considered a XML wrapper for text that is formated via RTF.  See annotations under the "Body" element for further details. 

Version 100 is also fairly simple in scope as it relies solely on the Microsoft RTF format.

						<xs:documentation>Microsoft RTF format.

GUI elements such as the WPF RichTextBox can display RTF encoding, and allow for the use of different fonts, textFormatting, textsize, tabulations, textcolor, etc.
In most cases Journal entries will be shown without any problem – but any RTF control will only show the data that is supported by the used RTF specification. This means that a specific RTF control may not show extended data that was created in a newer RTF control with a newer version of RTF.
Note: The Noah 4 Journal module uses the RTF version that is available with WPF.

Q: Where can a subject or heading for a journal be saved?
A: the journal standard does not support this but rather relies upon the Noah action description to save this.  Noah compatible software will need to save a subject or heading as part of the Noah action description.
