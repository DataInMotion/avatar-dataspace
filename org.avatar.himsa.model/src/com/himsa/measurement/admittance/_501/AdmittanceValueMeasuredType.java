 * The admittance Curve depicts the modulus recording of the admittance, i.e. the length of a complex value, calculated by using PythagorasÂ´ sentence. In this
 * structure, both the real and the imaginary part of the value or the value is saved, but for practical purposes, the admittance can be considered 90 degrees out of
 * phase (real part approximately zero) at the Max. admittance point. This rule applies only for probe frequencies near 220 Hz e.g. 226 Hz.
 * 
 * The application saving the data which comes from an automated solution (gathering all data from the device) is assumed to save data via the Measured choice and provide the G and B values.  Y can later be caluculated by any applicaiton reading the data.
 * 
 * OR
 * 
 * If the applicaiton (e.g. HIMSA's Audiogram module) provides a simple/manual method to record results it is assumed to use the Calculated choice
