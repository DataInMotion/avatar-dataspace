					<xs:annotation>
						<xs:documentation>Date of Audiogram that was used for the hearing instrument fitting

With NOAH 3 and newer this element is irrelevant.  When a fitting module saves a fitting action it will create a reference to the audiogram action (a referenced action).  This information can be found at the level of the action and not in the public data area of the actual action. </xs:documentation>

						<xs:documentation>HIMSA does not support using this element for storage in format 500+

In the past it was allowed by HIMSA to save privately formatted data in the unused section of the public storage area of a NOAH action.  This usage was used mainly because more space was allocated for public storage versus private.  At present this is no longer an issue as equal storage is allocated to both public and private data storage.

This elements primary function is to pass along any private data stored in the public area as base64 encoded data.  NOAH is not performing any translation or conversion of data.

The data will be upconverted from format 100 to format 500

This data will never be converted back to an earlier version of a Hearing Instrument Fitting data standard.  For example, if an fitting actions format 500 is saved with this element populated and then an older NOAH compatible fitting module tries to read the Audiogram (causing a conversion down to format 100) this data will be ignored by the converter process.

					<xs:documentation>NOAH Software is the only software package allowed to enter or change the entry in this element.  HIMSA will consider any other software packages altering this value as data corruption and thus result in a critical certification issue.

NOAH 4 will add a new feature which will validate data created using this schema file (i.e. a module saves data in XML format).  When saving data NOAH will also validate it against the schema file, if the validation passes the value of True will be entered.  A true value for this element will assure other software developers that the data has indeed been validated against the schema file.

Please note that data being presented in XML but being up converted from another older version (e.g. format 100 or 200) will NOT be validated by HIMSA and the value will set to false.  In this event the "ConvertedFromDataStandard" element will be properly set by NOAH as well.

@@When data is converted the converter DLL must entered a value of false as it will not be validating @@</xs:documentation>
